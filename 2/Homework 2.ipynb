    "- Read [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html) in the New York Times.\n",
    "- Use what we've learned in class and from the book to describe how one could set Target's problem up as a predictive modeling problem, such that they could have gotten the results that they did.  Formulate your solution as a proposed plan using our data science terminology.  Include all the aspects of the formulation that you see as relevant to solving the problem.  Be precise but concise."

    "#### Problem understanding:\n",
    "Target's objective is to identify when its female shoppers are pregnant so they can more easily change their shopping habits and make them buy everything at Target, and not only cleanning supplies or furniture. This happens because in certain major events in life, people are more likely to modify their well ingrained habits. When these moments happen, a good tactic from Target can be to \"attack\" them with precise ads, promotions or coupons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science overall approach:\n",
    "Given the previous information as valid and known, from a Data Science point of view, we could set this problem as follows: we want to identify from collected data when a particular costumer is likely to be pregnant. More formally:\n",
    "- Hypothesis: pregnant costumers can be detected by studying their shopping behavior over time.\n",
    "- Data Collection: all sort of information Target can possible collect, will be collected in order to find patterns in it to predict future cases.\n",
    "- Confirm/Falsify hypothesis upon results.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the data mining process, we can formally say:\n",
    "- First we need to understand the business of our underlying problem, and thus, point at the data we will potentially need or consider that might be useful. We can go back and forth from business to data understanding until we converge into the right approach. More specifically, for Target's case, we need to understand what shopping factors might be involved when a woman is pregnant, and how Target can detect them using different techniques: this can be storing costumer data in a database.\n",
    "- After this, we can start preparing the data. This is, converting raw collected data into ordered understandable data that we can analyze, and creating our predictive model. For Target's case, we simply clean, and standarize all costumers data, and prepare our predicting model following Data Science well known algorithms and statistics.\n",
    "- Next we start evaluating our model. For this, we can test on real costumers, but not in all of them. This would reduce the risk if something goes wrong. Over time, we would test how women that are likely pregnant, turns out that are actually pregnant. Also, and going even further, we can analyze if we eventually could change their overall shopping habits or not. It is important to note that if we realize our model is not working correctly, we need to re-think and reconsider our business and data understanding (first step).\n",
    "- Last, and only if our model behaved well in the evaluation step, we will deploy the whole model to production. This is, in Target, all female costumers will be analyzed and predicted if they are pregnant or not, so that Target can act consequently offering promotions of coupons to definitively change their shopping habits."

    "### Part 2: Exploring data in the command line\n",
    "For this part we will be using the data file located in `\"advertising_events.csv\"`. This file consists of records that pertain to some online advertising events on a given day. There are 4 comma separated columns in this order: `userid`, `timestamp`, `domain`, and `action`. These fields are of type `int`, `int`, `string`, and `int` respectively. Answer the following questions using Linux/Unix bash commands. All questions can be answered in one line (sometimes, with pipes)! Some questions will have many possible solutions. Don't forget that in IPython notebooks you must prefix all bash commands with an exclamation point, i.e. `\"!command arguments\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hints: You can experiment with whatever you want in the notebook and then delete things to construct your answer later.  You can also use ssh to use the actual bash shell in your terminal and then just paste your answers here. Recall that once you enter the \"!\" then filename completion should work. Also, these are standard data exploration commands that are quick and easy to use in a terminal or in the notebook. We don't cover command line operations formally in this class, but these are worth learning (and thus are part of the HW). Be resourceful. Use whatever online cheat sheets or Stackoverflow to answer the question.]"
